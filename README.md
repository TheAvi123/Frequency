A Game Created for the 2019 Tiancai Hackathon - Casual Mobile Game Category

NOTE: The majority of the commits made to the repository are through my second github account TheDracoRex. Both accounts belong to me and I was the only one to work on this project. Unfortunately, when registering for the hackathon of the Tiancai website, I connected this github account to my profile and couldn't find a way to change the linked github account, which I why I transferred repository ownership to this account and submitted through here.
