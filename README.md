# Frequency
A Game Created for the 2019 Tiancai Hackathon - Casual Mobile Game Category

# NOTE:
The majority of the commits made to the repository are through my second github account TheDracoRex. Both accounts belong to me and I was the only one to work on this project. Unfortunately, when registering for the hackathon of the Tiancai website, I connected this github account to my profile and couldn't find a way to change the linked github account, which I why I transferred repository ownership to this account and submitted through here.

# SCRIPTS LOCATION:
The game was programmed in the C# language. In order to view these scripts, please navigate to "Assets" -> "Scripts" in the github project. There are subfolders for the different scripts and within these folders you should be able to open any of the .cs (C Sharp) files. Please ignore the .cs.meta files. 

# BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
I have already built the game and created an APK file. In order to play the game yourselves, please download the APK file from the google drive link below. Copy the APK file or directly download it onto your phone and install like a normal app. The phone may ask you to allow installation.

The APK file is 37.4 MB large and will only run on Android phones.
